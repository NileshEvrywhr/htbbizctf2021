#rev basics
- figure out what the program does
- binary written using which language? (not super important, personal preference)

start with strings, strace, ltrace?

#tools
radare2, ghidra, IDA, bninja - disassembler, debugger for executables, analyze code in assembly language, very cool stuff

#what to do?
- understand basic flow of the program
- find main, since execution ususally start from there
- replicate in another scripting language?
